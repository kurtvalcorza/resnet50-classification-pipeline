        "At inference the network maps one normalized 3×224×224 tensor to 1000 logits in a single forward pass; the "
        "pipeline applies a softmax and reports the argmax class plus the top-k classes with their scores. "
        "**In-kernel fine-tuning:** this notebook demonstrates both zero-shot base inference on ImageNet-1k classes and "
        "100% in-kernel classification head fine-tuning on custom classes using PyTorch AdamW optimization and cross-entropy "
        "loss. The upstream checkpoint supplies the pretrained backbone weights, and the carried pipeline module adds snapshot "
        "verification, input validation, head adaptation via `fit`, fresh-boundary reload verification, and the "
        "`top_k_accuracy`, `validate_inputs` and `evaluation_report` helpers. The default sample is a synthetic image "
        "generated in code; its prediction is demonstration (plumbing) evidence, not a production-quality or benchmark claim."

        "install the pinned runtime, read what the carried pipeline module guarantees, resolve and digest-verify the "

        "100% in-kernel fine-tuning on custom classes with AdamW and cross-entropy, export and fresh-reload fine-tuned "
        "artifacts, exercise an optional BYOD path, produce an evaluation report that is `sample-sanity` only when a "
        "ground-truth class index exists and `not-measurable` otherwise, and export machine-readable outputs plus provenance."
    ),
    "exclusions": (
        "object detection, segmentation, multi-label tagging, OCR, open-vocabulary classification, feature/embedding "

        "- **Knowledge:** basic Python and PIL image handling; what a softmax over class logits is.",

Optional BYOD upload is gated off by default so the sample path can run top-to-bottom without interaction.
